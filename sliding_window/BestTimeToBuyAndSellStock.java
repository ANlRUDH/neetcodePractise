LeetCode 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: No transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

public class BestTimeToBuyAndSellStock {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE, maxProfit = 0;
        for (int price : prices) {
            if (price < minPrice) minPrice = price;
            else if (price - minPrice > maxProfit) maxProfit = price - minPrice;
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}

/*
Explanation:
We keep track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit. For each price, update the minimum or calculate the profit if sold today.
