LeetCode 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.
Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

Example 1:
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4

        int[] count = new int[26];
        int left = 0, maxCount = 0, maxLen = 0;
        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            count[s.charAt(right) - 'A']++;
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count[s.charAt(right) - 'A']);
            while (right - left + 1 - maxCount > k) {
                count[s.charAt(left) - 'A']--;
                left++;
            }

    }
}

/*
Explanation:
We use a sliding window and keep track of the count of the most frequent character in the window. If the window size minus the max count is greater than k, shrink the window from the left.
