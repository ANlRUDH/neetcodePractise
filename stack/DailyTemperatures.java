LeetCode 739. Daily Temperatures

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Example 1:
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]

Example 2:
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]

Example 3:
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]

import java.util.Stack;

public class DailyTemperatures {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {
        int n = temperatures.length;
        int[] answer = new int[n];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack.peek()]) {
                int idx = stack.pop();
                answer[idx] = i - idx;
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }
        return answer;
    }
}

/*
Explanation:
We use a stack to keep indices of the days. For each day, we pop from the stack until we find a warmer day, and calculate the difference in days. If no warmer day is found, the answer remains 0.
