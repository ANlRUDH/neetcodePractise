/*
LeetCode 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values), which is rotated at an unknown pivot. Given the array nums and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
            if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
                if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) right = mid - 1;
                else left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) left = mid + 1;
                else right = mid - 1;

/*
Explanation:
We use binary search. Determine which side is sorted, and check if the target is within that side. Adjust the search range accordingly.
