LeetCode 74. Search a 2D Matrix

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false

public class SearchA2DMatrix {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        int m = matrix.length, n = matrix[0].length;
        int left = 0, right = m * n - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int val = matrix[mid / n][mid % n];
            if (val == target) return true;
            else if (val < target) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid - 1;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

/*
Explanation:
Treat the 2D matrix as a 1D sorted array and apply binary search. Map the 1D index to 2D coordinates using (mid / n, mid % n).
